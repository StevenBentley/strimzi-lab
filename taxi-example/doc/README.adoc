Within this article we describe the steps required to get started with
building your own Kafka Streams application using Strimzi. We start
with a simple example and build upon it to create a multi-stage
pipeline, performing some operations on the data stream, and visualising
at the consumer.

== Example using real data
Building upon the basic example above, we will look at the design decisions and considerations while building an application to process a real-life data set.
